            <p>I am driven by the desire to succeed and am eager to apply my strong leadership experiences, and interpersonal skills to achieve this success. I always look forward to new experiences and further developing my professional and soft skills.</p>
            <p>As treasurer of Asian American Student Union I acquired strong leadership and interpersonal skills. I am able to think quickly in emergency situations and in those requiring quick assessment of many factors in order to make appropriate decisions. Dealing with the diverse concerns of students and faculty, I have become adept at operating with the proper mix of authority, diplomacy, and tact. I am responsible, dedicated and open to learning new skills. The leadership position, in AASU, is one of the many opportunities that I have taken up to expand my professional skills. I have also worked with and lead many other organizations and clubs.</p>
            <!-- <p>Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.</p>
